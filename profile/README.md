###  🐕 What is GetAPet?

GetAPet is a free platform that is built from the ground up to connect several animal shelters. We are building a platform that is entirely open-source and transparent in our actions designed to be community driven.

### 👀 Project status

We are currently in the process of building the platform! We are looking for contributors to help us and we are always open to new ideas.

We have a public [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/withGetAPet/projects/2/views/2) and [kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/withGetAPet/projects/2/views/1) where we update the statuses of the projects and tickets we are working on.

### 📖 Contributing

If you are interested in contributing, you can reach out to us on our [Discord](https://withgetapet.com/discord) or create a [issue](https://github.com/withGetAPet/getapet/issues).

We are very friendly and we are more than happy to teach you and help you get started.

### 🦀 Our stack

Our stack is mostly Rust and we use Svelte for the frontend.

You can find the source-code for all of our services on our [monorepo](https://github.com/withGetAPet/getapet).
